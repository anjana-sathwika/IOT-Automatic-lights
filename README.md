# IOT-Automatic-lights
An IoT-based Automatic Lights project focuses on using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to automatically control lighting systems. This project is typically implemented to save energy, enhance convenience, and improve user experience. Below is a detailed breakdown of this project, including its objectives, components, working, and potential enhancements.

Objective
To create a smart lighting system that automatically turns lights on or off based on environmental conditions such as ambient light, presence of people, or time of day. The system is connected to the internet for remote monitoring and control.

Key Features
Automatic Control: Lights turn on when motion is detected or when the light level falls below a threshold.
Energy Efficiency: Reduces unnecessary energy consumption by ensuring lights are only active when needed.
Remote Access: Allows users to control lights via a smartphone or web application.
Customization: Users can set schedules, brightness levels, or modes (e.g., night mode).
Components
Hardware Components

Microcontroller or IoT Development Board:
Arduino Uno, ESP8266, or ESP32 (with Wi-Fi for IoT connectivity).
Sensors:
PIR Sensor: Detects motion.
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): Measures ambient light levels.
Ultrasonic Sensor (optional): Detects objects or people.
Relay Module:
Controls the switching of lights.
Light Bulb or LED:
The output device.
Power Supply:
For powering the microcontroller and sensors.
Wi-Fi Router:
For IoT connectivity.
Wires and Breadboard:
For circuit connections.
Software Components

Arduino IDE:
For coding the microcontroller.
Blynk App (or any IoT platform):
For remote control and monitoring.
MQTT Broker (optional):
For communication between devices.
IFTTT (optional):
To integrate with other smart home systems.
Working
Sensor Input:
The PIR sensor detects motion and sends a signal to the microcontroller.
The LDR measures the ambient light intensity and provides input on whether artificial lighting is needed.
Processing:
The microcontroller processes the sensor data and decides whether to turn the lights on or off.
The decision is based on preset thresholds (e.g., motion detected in a dark room).
Output Control:
If the conditions are met, the microcontroller activates the relay module, which switches the light on or off.
IoT Connectivity:
The system updates its status on the IoT platform.
Users can override the system via a smartphone app or dashboard.
Remote Access:
The user can check the system status and control it manually using the app or web interface.
Steps to Build the Project
